# 30 Days Better English - Project Rules

## Project Overview
This is a 30-day English speaking practice program focused on B1 level common phrases and sentences. The goal is to help users improve their spoken English through daily practice with progressively increasing content.

## Content Structure

### Daily Progression
- Day 1: 15 sentences
- Day 2: 16 sentences  
- Day 3: 17 sentences
- ...and so on
- Day 30: 44 sentences

Each day adds ONE more sentence than the previous day.

### File Format for Each Day

Each day's file (day_1.md to day_30.md) should follow this exact format:

```markdown
# Day X - Y cÃ¢u

**1. [English sentence]**
/[IPA pronunciation]/
> [Detailed explanation in English about when and how to use this sentence]

**2. [English sentence]**
/[IPA pronunciation]/
> [Detailed explanation in English about when and how to use this sentence]

...
```

### Content Requirements

1. **Sentences**: 
   - Must be at B1 English level
   - Focus on common, practical phrases used in daily conversation
   - Should cover various topics: greetings, introductions, work, hobbies, social situations, etc.
   - Each sentence should be bold formatted

2. **Pronunciation**:
   - Provide IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet) pronunciation
   - Place on a separate line immediately after the sentence
   - Format: /phonetic transcription/

3. **Explanation**:
   - Must be in English only (no Vietnamese translation)
   - Place inside a quote block (markdown > syntax)
   - Explain WHEN to use the sentence (context, situation)
   - Explain WHY it's useful (purpose, tone, formality level)
   - Keep explanations clear and practical

4. **Spacing**:
   - Add a blank line between each sentence group
   - This improves readability and makes practice easier

### Quality Guidelines

- Sentences should form natural conversations when possible
- Avoid repetitive structures across different days
- Progress from basic to more complex structures as days advance
- Include a mix of questions, statements, and responses
- Focus on real-world applicability

### File Naming
- Use lowercase with underscores: day_1.md, day_2.md, etc.
- Store all files in the /plans directory

## Do NOT Create
- No README.md files
- No documentation files unless explicitly requested
- No summary or overview files
