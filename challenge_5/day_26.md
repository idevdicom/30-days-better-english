> Tôi thích đi bộ dài trong rừng và lắng nghe âm thanh của chim chóc và gió. Tôi thực sự thích mùa xuân vì mọi thứ đang trở lại cuộc sống và không khí cảm thấy rất trong lành. Có một hồ nhỏ gần quê nhà tôi được bao quanh bởi những cây thông cao. Tôi thích ngồi yên lặng và đọc sách, hoặc đôi khi chỉ nhắm mắt và lắng nghe âm thanh tự nhiên. Tôi đã học được rằng thiên nhiên có nhịp điệu và tốc độ riêng của nó, và điều quan trọng là phải chậm lại và đánh giá cao nó. Tôi yêu âm thanh của mưa trên lá và tiếng xào xạc nhẹ nhàng của gió qua cây cối. Tôi cố gắng có cây trong nhà và mở cửa sổ để đón không khí trong lành và âm thanh tự nhiên. Tôi đã từng thấy một gia đình hươu vào lúc bình minh, và đó là một khoảnh khắc thật kỳ diệu và yên bình. Tôi muốn thăm nhiều công viên quốc gia hơn và dành thời gian trong các môi trường tự nhiên khác nhau. Tôi nghĩ điều quan trọng là bảo tồn sự yên tĩnh và hòa bình mà thiên nhiên mang lại, xa khỏi tiếng ồn và hoạt động của con người. Tôi đã học được rằng mọi thứ trong thiên nhiên đều có thời gian và mục đích riêng của nó, và chúng ta nên tôn trọng nhịp điệu tự nhiên đó!
