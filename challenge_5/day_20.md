> Tôi nghĩ kỹ năng có giá trị nhất tôi đã phát triển là khả năng lắng nghe tích cực và đồng cảm. Tôi nhận thấy rằng mọi người sẽ cởi mở hơn với tôi khi tôi thực sự lắng nghe, và điều đó tạo ra những kết nối sâu sắc hơn. Đôi khi thật khó để cưỡng lại sự thôi thúc đưa ra lời khuyên hoặc chia sẻ kinh nghiệm của chính mình. Tôi cố gắng tập trung hoàn toàn vào người đang nói và đặt câu hỏi tiếp theo để thể hiện tôi đang tham gia. Tôi yêu cách nó giúp tôi hiểu mọi người tốt hơn và xây dựng các mối quan hệ mạnh mẽ hơn. Tôi nghĩ mọi người thường nhầm lẫn giữa nghe và lắng nghe, nhưng lắng nghe đòi hỏi nhiều nỗ lực và sự chú ý hơn. Một người bạn đã từng nói với tôi rằng việc lắng nghe của tôi đã giúp họ vượt qua thời kỳ khó khăn, và điều đó có ý nghĩa rất lớn với tôi. Tôi đã học được rằng giao tiếp không chỉ là về việc nói, mà còn là tạo ra một không gian nơi người khác cảm thấy được lắng nghe và đánh giá cao!
