> Sinh nhật 25 tuổi của tôi thật tuyệt vời vì bạn bè đã bất ngờ tổ chức một bữa tiệc cho tôi. Tôi hoàn toàn không biết họ đang lên kế hoạch, vì vậy đó là một bất ngờ hoàn toàn. Điều làm tôi nhớ nhất không chỉ là bữa tiệc mà còn là sự nỗ lực mà bạn bè tôi đã bỏ ra để làm cho nó hoàn hảo. Tôi nghĩ tôi thích cả hai, nhưng những bất ngờ đặc biệt có ý nghĩa vì chúng cho thấy mọi người hiểu bạn đến mức nào. Tôi yêu bánh kem và hát chúc mừng, nhưng tôi nghĩ phần tốt nhất là được bao quanh bởi những người quan tâm đến bạn. Chúng tôi luôn có một bữa tối đặc biệt và mẹ tôi làm chiếc bánh kem yêu thích của tôi. Bạn thân nhất của tôi đã tặng tôi một album ảnh tự làm về những kỷ niệm của chúng tôi cùng nhau. Tôi thực sự thích tặng quà hơn là nhận chúng. Tôi cố gắng nghĩ về điều gì sẽ khiến họ hạnh phúc và phản ánh tính cách của họ!
