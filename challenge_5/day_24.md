Tôi cũng thích nghe nhạc êm dịu và thực hiện một số động tác kéo giãn nhẹ nhàng. Tôi thực sự thích nhạc cụ, đặc biệt là piano và các tác phẩm cổ điển. Đôi khi thật khó để tắt suy nghĩ và ngừng nghĩ về công việc hoặc các trách nhiệm khác. Tôi cố gắng tập trung vào hơi thở và nhắc nhở bản thân rằng thời gian này chỉ dành cho tôi. Tôi nghĩ thiền định là hoạt động thư giãn nhất đối với tôi, mặc dù nó cần một số luyện tập. Tôi thích buổi tối vì nó giúp tôi chuyển từ chế độ làm việc sang chế độ nghỉ ngơi. Tôi đã học được rằng thư giãn không phải là xa xỉ - đó là điều cần thiết để duy trì sức khỏe và hạnh phúc của tôi. Tôi yêu cách nó giúp tôi cảm thấy sảng khoái và sẵn sàng đối mặt với ngày hôm sau với thái độ tích cực!
