## Bài tập luyện viết

**Bài tập: Chuyển từ tiếng Việt sang tiếng Anh**

> Tôi thực sự thích vẽ và vẽ tranh vì nó cho phép tôi thể hiện cảm xúc và ý tưởng của mình một cách trực quan. Tôi yêu vẽ phong cảnh và cảnh thiên nhiên vì chúng giúp tôi kết nối với thế giới tự nhiên. Đôi khi thật khó để dịch những gì tôi thấy hoặc cảm nhận thành những gì tôi muốn tạo ra trên canvas. Tôi cố gắng luyện tập thường xuyên và nghiên cứu tác phẩm của các nghệ sĩ tôi ngưỡng mộ để học các kỹ thuật mới. Tôi thực sự thích làm việc với màu nước vì chúng rất linh hoạt và không thể đoán trước. Tôi yêu khoảnh khắc khi một bức tranh cuối cùng cũng hoàn thành và cảm thấy hoàn chỉnh. Tôi muốn có triển lãm nghệ thuật riêng và chia sẻ tác phẩm của mình với khán giả rộng hơn. Tôi đã học được rằng sáng tạo là một quá trình, không chỉ là kết quả, và điều quan trọng là tận hưởng hành trình. Tôi thích đi dạo trong thiên nhiên và thăm các phòng trưng bày nghệ thuật để xem các nghệ sĩ khác đang tạo ra gì. Tôi yêu cách sáng tạo cho phép tôi thể hiện những phần của bản thân mà từ ngữ không thể nắm bắt được. Tôi nghĩ điều quan trọng là mọi người biết rằng sáng tạo dành cho tất cả mọi người, không chỉ các nghệ sĩ chuyên nghiệp!
